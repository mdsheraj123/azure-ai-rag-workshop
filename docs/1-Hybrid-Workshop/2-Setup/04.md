# 2.4 Add App Insights

## Tracing & Observability

While not covered explicitly in the [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/tutorials/copilot-sdk-create-resources?tabs=macos#create-an-azure-ai-search-service), we will be working with code in the **Ideate section** that is instrumented for observability (tracing). 

- See: How to [Trace your application with Azure AI Inference SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/trace-local-sdk?tabs=python)


In order to visualize those traces in the Azure AI Foundry Portal, we need to **attach an Application Insights resource** to our Azure AI project ahead of time.
