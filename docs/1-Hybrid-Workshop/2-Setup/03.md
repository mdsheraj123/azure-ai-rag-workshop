# 2.3 [Add Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/tutorials/copilot-sdk-create-resources?tabs=macos#create-an-azure-ai-search-service)

The [official tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/tutorials/copilot-sdk-create-resources?tabs=macos#create-an-azure-ai-search-service) recommends setting up an Azure AI Search resource at this stage. This was done under the assumption that the default Azure AI project setup did not create (new) or reuse (existing) Azure AI Search resources. 

However, since we opted to [add Azure AI Search during project setup](./01.md#5-create-new-ai-search), we have nothing further to do at this stage! Note that the search resource is not yet populated with our data (search indexes). We'll get there in the **Ideate** section.
