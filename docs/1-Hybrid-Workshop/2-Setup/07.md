# 2.7 Configure Env Variables

We are now ready to start coding the chat AI application in our local development environment. But to do this, we need to configure a few environment variables.

---

## 1. Create `.env` file

1. Start by copying the `.env.sample` file to `.env`

```bash title=""
cp .env.sample .env
```

1. Let's review what this contains

```bash title=""
cat .env
```

You will see something like this:

```bash title=""
AIPROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING=<your-connection-string>
AISEARCH_INDEX_NAME="contoso-products"
EMBEDDINGS_MODEL="text-embedding-ada-002"
INTENT_MAPPING_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
CHAT_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
EVALUATION_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
```

---

## 2. Update Connection String
Note that defaults are provided for everything except the `AIPROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING` - let's fix that now!

1. Open the Azure AI Project overview page. It should look like this:

    ![Project](./../img/p1-01-create/p1-create-project-08.png)

1. Look for the **Project connection string** under the _Project details_ tab. 
1. Copy that into `.env` as the _AIPROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING_ value.
1. Save the changes to `.env`

---

## 3. Review Environment Variables

Let's review our environment variables:

1. `AIPROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING` - is a single connection URI that allows access to all the Connected Resources in the Azure AI project (including Azure AI Search).
1. `AISEARCH_INDEX_NAME` - is set to `contoso-products` and represents the index name that we will create and populate with product catalog data.
1. `EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` - the deployed model we'll use for vectorizing queries (see: Ideate 3.2)
1. `INTENT_MAPPING_MODEL` - the deployed model we'll use for intent mapping (see: Ideate 3.4)
1. `CHAT_MODEL` - the deployed model we'll use for final chat response (see: Ideate 3.6)
1. `EVALUATION_MODEL` - the deployed model we'll use for quality evaluation (see: Evaluate 4.3)
