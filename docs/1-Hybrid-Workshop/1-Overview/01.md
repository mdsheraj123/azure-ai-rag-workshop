# 1.2 Application Scenario

In this tutorial, we build a retail chat AI (copilot) that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground the chat responses in the retailer's own data. Let's briefly review what this means.

## 1. RAG Chat App (tutorial)

This RAG Chat tutorial provides a quickstart for building and evaluating a basic RAG-based copilot using the Azure AI Foundry portal and SDK. The tutorial is grounded in the Contoso Outdoors retailer data and combines both low-code (Portal) and code-first (SDK) steps to teach the latest Azure AI Foundry tools and features. **Think of this as a sandbox for open exploration**

The figure explains the RAG pattern visually:

1. The user question (prompt) is received at the copilot hosted endpoint
1. The question is used to **retrieve** related knowledge from relevant sources.
1. The prompt is then **augmented** with knowledge as context, and sent to the model.
1. The model now **generates** a response that is "grounded" in this knowledge context.

## 2. Contoso Outdoor (chat UI)

Contoso Outdoor is a fictitious enterprise retailer specializing in hiking and camping gear for outdoor enthusiasts. Their website (chat UI) provides customers with a catalog of their products, with product pages offering detailed information for user review. **We'll look at the retailer data sources in the next section**.

## 3. Contoso Chat (chat AI)

!!! info "The chat UI shown is not used in THIS workshop - but code is open-source if useful."

Contoso Chat is the open-source reference implementation of a custom RAG-based retail copilot based on the Contoso Outdoor retail scenario. It is implemented as an [AI App Template](https://aka.ms/ai-apps) that can be provisioned and deployed to Azure Container Apps to provide a hosted API endpoint. Customer requests on the chat UI (website) are now directed to this chat AI (endpoint) for processing, allowing for the user experience shown below.
