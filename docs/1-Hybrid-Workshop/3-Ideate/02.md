# 3.2 Create Search Index

## 1. Create Search Index Script

 Let's copy over the `create-search-index.py` script into our application source folder.

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the repo.
1. Then run this command:

    ```bash title=""
    cp src.sample/api/create-search-index.py  src/api/.
    ```

---

## 2. Understand Index Creation

Now, let's take a look at what this does.

??? info "Click to expand and view the Python Script to create the search index"

    ```python title="src/api/create-search-index.py"

        import os
        from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
        from azure.ai.projects.models import ConnectionType
        from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
        from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
        from azure.search.documents import SearchClient
        from azure.search.documents.indexes import SearchIndexClient
        from config import get_logger

        # initialize logging object
        logger = get_logger(__name__)

        # create a project client using environment variables loaded from the .env file
        project = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(
            conn_str=os.environ["AIPROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING"], credential=DefaultAzureCredential()
        )

        # create a vector embeddings client that will be used to generate vector embeddings
        embeddings = project.inference.get_embeddings_client()

        # use the project client to get the default search connection
        search_connection = project.connections.get_default(
            connection_type=ConnectionType.AZURE_AI_SEARCH, include_credentials=True
        )

        # Create a search index client using the search connection
        # This client will be used to create and delete search indexes
        index_client = SearchIndexClient(
            endpoint=search_connection.endpoint_url, credential=AzureKeyCredential(key=search_connection.key)
        )
    ```

First the script sets up a search **index_client**:

1. Creates an Azure AI Project Client instance (configured with connection string)
1. Retrieves an `embeddings` inference client from the AI project (maps to that model)
1. Retrieves a `search_connection` object from the AI project instance
1. Creates an `index_client` search index client using the search connection (key, endpoint)

First it  **defines the index** based on a vector derived from product data fields.

1. It maps product _name_ to a _title_ property
1. It maps product _description_ to a _content_ property
1. It uses HNSW algorithm (_cosine distance_) for similarity
1. It prioritizes "content" for semantic ranking

It then **creates the index from CSV** and populates it using the index_client.

1. It defines an index using the specified name and embeddings model
1. It loads CSV and generates vector embeddings for each `description` 
1. It uploads each vectorized document into the pre-defined search index

---

## 3. Run Index Creation Script

To get the index created in Azure AI Search, 

1. Change to the `src/api` folder 

    ```bash title=""
    cd src/api
    ```

1. Run the script:

    ```bash title=""
    python create-search-index.py
    ```

---

## 4. Verify Search Index


Then verify that the index was created successfully:

1. Visit the Azure Portal and look up your Resource Group
1. Visit the Azure AI Search resource page from that RG
1. Click on "Search Explorer" from the resource overview page
1. Click "Search" - verify that you see indexed products
