# Introduction

## Azure AI Foundry Architecture

The [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/architecture) provides a **unified experience for both AI developers and data scientists** to build, evaluate, and deploy AI models through a **web portal, SDK, or CLI**. The Azure AI Foundry is built on capabilities and services provided by other Azure services.

     The figure below provides the big picture of the core components and capabilities provide to support end-to-end development of enterprise-grade generative AI solutions.

## RAG Chat App Workshops

This repository contains the source and instructions guide for a workshop that takes you step-by-step through the process of building a RAG-based chat app using Azure AI Foundry. 

!!! info "The Guide has TWO Learning Paths - Pick one! ðŸ†•"

    Pick the path that reflects your interest and experience level: 
    
    - The **Hybrid Workshop** is derived from [the official 3-part tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/tutorials/copilot-sdk-create-resources) and uses both the Azure AI Foundry Portal (for setup) and Azure AI Foundry Python SDK (for ideation & evaluation). _This is a code-first experience_.
    - The **Portal First** Workshop focuses on using the Azure AI Foundry Portal to maximize the end-to-end development workflow without SDK. _This is a low-code experience_.

## Pre-Requisites

To get the most from this lab, you will need the following:

1. An Azure subscription - [Get one for free](https://aka.ms/azure/free)
1. A GitHub account - [Get one for free](https://github.com/signup)
1. Familiarity with VS Code, Github & Azure.
1. Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.


**Verify:** Your Azure subscription has sufficient quota to deploy these models:

1. Chat: `gpt-4o-mini` 
1. Embeddings: `text-embedding-ada-002`

**Verify:** Your Azure account is authorized to make role assignments for Azure AI resources. This may involve having a [Privileged role](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) like Owner, User Access Admin or RBAC Admin.
