# 1.2 Azure AI Foundry Portal

Let's first review key concepts and components with respect the Azure AI Foundry Portal and get a broad sense of how they connect. Two resources that can help:

- [Azure AI Foundry Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/) - canonical source.
- [Azure AI Foundry Documentation Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/full#?d=github%3Anitya%2Flearns-with-markmaps%40refs%3Aheads%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Fazure-ai-foundry.mm.md) - interactive visualization

## 1.2.1 Model Selection 

The [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) provides developers with acces to 1800+ models (open-source, frontier, and industry-specific) for development. You can explore the [model catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models) and [model benchmarks](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/benchmarks) in **guest mode** without having to log in. Try these steps to explore the catalog (click to expand for screenshots).
