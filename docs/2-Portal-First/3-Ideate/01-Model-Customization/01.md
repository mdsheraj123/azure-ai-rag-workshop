In the previous sections we completed _model selection_ and _model exploration_:

- We learned to use the model catalog and benchmarks to "select" a model
- We learned to use model deployment and chat playground to "explore" the model

We found the model works for our needs but we do need to ground the responses in our data! It's time to focus on _model customization_ with an emphasis on **Retrieval Augmented Generation** (RAG) where we add our data to ground model responses. Let's do that, next!


!!! quote "By the end of this section you should know how to:"

    - [X] Create and connect an Azure AI Search service to an AI project
    - [X] Create or update RBAC (role access permissions) for resources
    - [X] Add your data to the chat model playground for grounding
    - [X] Test your _grounded_ chat model interactively in playground
    - [X] Deploy that chat prototype as a standalone web application
    - [X] Use the deployed application (with history) or update it
