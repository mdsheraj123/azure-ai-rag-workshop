# 1. Learning Objectives

In the previous sections we completed model _selection_, _exploration_ and _customization_:

- We learned to use the model catalog and benchmarks to "select" a model
- We learned to use model deployment and chat playground to "explore" the model
- We learned to add search services and data to "ground" responses with RAG

We can test the grounded model in the playground, but now we want to get a sense for what a real-world user experience and interaction looks like. Let's deploy the grounded chat model to Azure, then add a web app to interact with it! This is what _model integration_ for real-world use, looks like.


!!! quote "By the end of this section you should know how to:"

    - [X] Deploy ground chat prototype as a hosted endpoint (chat API)
    - [X] Deploy a web based application to interact with it (chat UI)
    - [X] Use the deployed application (with history) or update it
