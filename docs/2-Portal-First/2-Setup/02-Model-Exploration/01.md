In the previous lab exercises, we learned about _model selection_ by:

- Visiting the **Azure AI Foundry portal** in guest mode.
- Using the **model catalog** to discover models that meet your needs
- Using the **model benchmarks** to compare relevant models by metrics
- Using the **model card** to understand costs, capabilities & code use.

We went from _1800 models_ to a single candidate. Now, we need to test this model out to see how well it "fits" our requuirements. To do this, we need to deploy the model and explore it interactively in a chat playground. Let's see how we can do this in Azure AI Foundry, next.

!!! quote "By the end of this section you should know how to:"

    - [X] Deploy a model from an Azure AI model catalog card
    - [X] Create an Azure AI project with a customized hub for this purpose
    - [X] View model deployment details in the Azure AI project
    - [X] View project and hub resource details in the Management center
    - [X] Launch the chat playground for the deployed model (and use it)
