# 5. Data, Privacy, & Security

When you deploy and customize models in the Azure AI Foundry portal, the service processes data in different contexts. These include:

1. **Prompts** - the initial user request, as well as metaprompts and RAG-enhanced context.
1. **Generated Content** - the response generated by the model, potentially as chat history.
1. **Uploaded Data** - loaded into a datastore for fine-tuning or other AI customization.
1. **Content Filters** - analyze prompts and responses to detect and filter harmful content.

Some of the common questions on data security and privacy are:

- Is the data stored, shared with providers, or reused for training?
- Who is processing the data, and what are their data commitments?
