Models are the brains of our generative AI applications. The first step of your end-to-end developer workflow is _model selection_. This consists of three steps:

1. Discovery - see if there exists an AI model for your need.
1. Selection - choose the right model from available matches.
1. Usage - deploy, customize, and evaluate, the model for fit.

The Azure AI Foundry portal helps support the model selection journey with three features:

1. [Model catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog-overview) - for discovery
1. [Model benchmarks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/model-benchmarks) - for comparison
1. [Model deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/deployments-overview) - for evaluation

!!! quote "By the end of this section you should know how to:"

    - [X] Filter the model catalog to discover relevant models
    - [X] Compare selected models using the model benchmarks
    - [X] Select a model and explore its model card for details
    - [X] Start a model deployment to experiment with it in Azure
