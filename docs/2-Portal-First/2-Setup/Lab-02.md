# 1. Lab: Model Exploration

The first step of your end-to-end developer workflow is _model selection_ where you **discover** one or more models that can **solve** your application requirements. 

This second step focuses on _model exploration_ where you deploy the model (in an Azure AI Foundry project) and then **experiment** with it (e.g., in a playground) using application-specific prompts, to see if (and how well) it fits your needs.

!!! quote "By the end of this section you should know how to:"

    - [X] Deploy a model from an Azure AI model catalog card
    - [X] Create an Azure AI project with a customized hub for this purpose
    - [X] View model deployment details in the Azure AI project
    - [X] View project and hub resource details in the Management center
    - [X] Launch the chat playground for the deployed model (and use it)
    - [X] Connect AI Services to your existing project (e.g., AI Search)
