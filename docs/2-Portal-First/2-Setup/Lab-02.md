The first step of your end-to-end developer workflow is _model selection_ where you **discover** one or more models that can **solve** your application requirements. 

This second step focuses on _model deployment_ where you create an Azure AI project with a managed model deployment, and use the Azure AI portal features to **experiment** with the model (using scenario-specific prompts) to verify that it fits your application needs.
